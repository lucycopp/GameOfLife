# GameOfLife

The Game of Life is zero player game known as an 'cellular automaton'. This means that rules are applied to cells and their neighbours in a grid, causing a variety of outcomes.
It is based on mathematician, John Conways,  Game of Life. The rules cause a large variety of interesting patterns to evolve.
The game is set on a 2D grid, in which each square a cell inhibits. These cells interact with their neighbours, and their state is determined after each iteration.
The following rules are applied to each cell:

- Underpopulation - If an alive cell has less than two neighbours it will die
- Overcrowding - If an alive cell has more than three neighbours it will die
- Survival - If a an alive cell has two or three neighbours it will live
- Creation of Life - When an empty cell has three neighbours, a cell will be created

The neighbours considered in each iteration, are the cells horizontally, vertically and diagonally adjacent to the cell.
